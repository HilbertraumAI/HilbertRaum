# Hardware benchmark & model recommendation

_Last updated: 2026-06-10 (real tokens/sec; injected GPU probe, conservative profile bump,
per-session probe refresh)._

The benchmark answers the spec §11.1 questions — *can this machine run a model, which
model, what context is safe, is the drive fast enough* — using **only local signals**. It
touches **zero network**: `node:os` + `node:fs` + `node:crypto` only, no `child_process`,
no remote probes, no telemetry. A no-network assertion guards the whole path in the test
suite.

Source: [`apps/desktop/src/main/services/benchmark.ts`](../apps/desktop/src/main/services/benchmark.ts).
IPC: `runBenchmark()` (`benchmark:run`) in
[`registerBenchmarkIpc.ts`](../apps/desktop/src/main/ipc/registerBenchmarkIpc.ts).

## Detection steps (spec §11.2)

1. **System** (`detectSystem`, `node:os`): `os` (platform), `arch`, `cpuModel` + `cpuCores`
   (`os.cpus()`), `ramGb` (`os.totalmem()` ÷ GiB, rounded to 0.1). Every probe is wrapped —
   a failure falls back to `''` / `0` and never throws.
2. **GPU** ([`architecture.md`](architecture.md) GPU record §5.1/§8): the IPC layer runs
   the **session-cached `llama-server --list-devices` probe** on the drive's own sidecar binary
   (`services/runtime/gpu.ts` — an offline subprocess, kill-timeout-bounded, never throws) and
   **injects** the summary into `runBenchmark` (`RunBenchmarkDeps.gpu: { name, useful }`).
   `benchmark.ts` itself keeps its **zero-`child_process` purity** — it never probes. The probe
   result is also persisted to `settings.gpuProbe` for Diagnostics. With no binary / no devices /
   a failed probe, `gpu` stays `null` and nothing blocks. The persisted probe is additionally
   refreshed **once per session** in the background (even when a benchmark already exists), so a
   drive moved to another machine re-labels itself; Diagnostics' "Try GPU again"
   (`gpu:try-again` IPC) invalidates the session cache and re-probes immediately.
3. **Drive speed** (`measureDriveSpeed`): writes a small temp file
   (`DRIVE_PROBE_BYTES = 8 MB` of random bytes) **inside the workspace**, times a sequential
   write (with `fsync`) then a read, and reports MB/s. The temp file is **always removed**
   (`try/finally`), the probe is **bounded** (8 MB) so it never hangs the UI, and any failure
   returns `null` Mbps + an `error` string instead of throwing.
4. **Tokens/sec** (`measureTokensPerSecond`): **optional**. Only runs when a runtime is
   active — it streams the prompt *"Write one sentence about privacy."* and times up to 64
   tokens. It is `null` when no runtime is running. Because `measureTokensPerSecond`
   drives off `runtime.chatStream`, this is now a **real** figure whenever the real `LlamaRuntime`
   is streaming (it remains a simulated figure under the mock runtime). The low-tokens/sec profile
   **downgrade** and the GPU **bump** therefore become live with real local inference.

## Profile classification (spec §11.3)

`classifyProfile(ramGb, { tokensPerSecond?, gpuUseful? })` — pure:

```text
ramGb <= 8   → TINY
ramGb <= 16  → LITE
ramGb <= 32  → BALANCED
else         → PRO
invalid ram  → UNKNOWN   (detection failed)
```

Adjustments, in order:
- A **useful GPU** bumps one step toward `PRO` (capped at `PRO`). "Useful" is the
  **conservative Phase-16 gate** (`gpuUsefulForProfile` in `runtime/gpu.ts`): some probed
  device has **≥ 6 GiB** (`GPU_BUMP_MIN_VRAM_MB = 6144`) **and** does not look integrated
  (`looksIntegrated` name heuristic, biased toward *not* bumping). Rationale: an Iris Xe
  reporting 16 GB of *shared* memory must never push a 16 GB laptop into BALANCED→PRO and a
  14B recommendation — a false negative only costs a too-small recommendation, never a
  too-big one.
- **Very low** throughput (`tokensPerSecond < VERY_LOW_TOKENS_PER_SECOND = 3`) downgrades one
  step (never below `TINY`).

## Recommendation

**The primary picker is RAM-best-fit, not profile lookup.** `runBenchmark` calls
`recommendModelIdByRam(manifests, round(ramGb), 'chat')`, which chooses the largest model that fits the
measured RAM, breaking ties on each manifest's `recommendation_rank`. The profile-based
`recommendModelId(manifests, profile, 'chat')` is only the **fallback** when RAM can't be detected
(`ramGb = 0`). With the committed manifests the live, real-hardware recommendations are:

| Measured RAM | Chat model |
|---|---|
| ≤ 12 GB | `qwen3-4b-instruct-q4` (also the bundled default) |
| 16–24 GB | `ministral3-8b-instruct-2512-q4` |
| ≥ 32 GB | `gemma4-12b-it-qat-q4` |

The profile fallback maps TINY/LITE/UNKNOWN → `qwen3-4b-instruct-q4`, BALANCED → `qwen3-8b-instruct-q4`,
PRO → `qwen3-14b-instruct-q4` (it matches a manifest whose `recommended_profiles` includes the profile).
Full benchmark detail and the rank rationale: [`model-benchmarks.md`](model-benchmarks.md) §6.2.

(`qwen3-1.7b-instruct-q4` was the TINY/UNKNOWN model in the original spec §7.3 table, but it was
dropped — the official `Qwen/Qwen3-1.7B-GGUF` repo ships no Q4_K_M — so `qwen3-4b-instruct-q4`,
the smallest bundled chat model, now also covers TINY + UNKNOWN. See BUILD_STATE §9.)

The larger `qwen3-30b-a3b-q4` (MoE) carries an **empty** `recommended_profiles` and is never
auto-recommended — it stays selectable on the AI Model screen as a deliberate opt-in (it needs ~20 GB
RAM but runs near-3B speed).

## Warnings (spec §11.3 + §11.4)

`buildWarnings(...)` is **encouraging, never judgmental** — it never says "your hardware is
bad":

- **TINY** → *"This device is best suited for the smallest, quickest model. Larger models may run slowly."*
- **UNKNOWN** → a friendly "we picked a safe, lightweight model" note.
- **Slow drive** (read or write `< SLOW_DRIVE_MBPS = 30` MB/s) → a non-blocking "models will
  still work, but loading may take longer" note. Slow drives **warn, never block**.
- **Drive un-measurable** → "drive speed could not be measured; recommendation uses RAM + CPU
  only."

## Persistence

Spec §8 defines **no `benchmarks` table**, so the last result is persisted via the **settings
store** as `AppSettings.lastBenchmark` (a JSON `BenchmarkResult`, default `null`).
`runBenchmark()` writes it after each run. Downstream reads use `lastBenchmark.profile`,
falling back to **`UNKNOWN`** until the user runs the benchmark for the first time:

- `getAppStatus().hardwareProfile` (Home screen).
- `buildModelList({ profile, … })` (AI Model screen `recommended` flag).

The Diagnostics screen surfaces a **Run benchmark** button and renders RAM / CPU / OS-arch /
drive read-write / tokens-sec / assigned profile / recommended model + the warnings, and
re-loads the last result from settings on mount.
