// process, NOT a network call; the no-network assertions are untouched).

// The probe can prove enumeration only, never stable inference — the start LADDER in
// factory.ts is the actual guarantee; this feeds the UI label, Diagnostics, and the
// conservative classifyProfile bump. Never throws: any failure → [].
